# gettingcleaningdata
This is a project 1 of Getting And Cleaning Data course. The purpose of this project is described as follows:- 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The script is "run_analysis.R". The output of this code is tidy data in "tidy_data.csv" file.
The assumption is that the exploded zip data is inside folder "UCI HAR Dataset" of the working directory. From the R command prompt, load the script e.g. source("run_analysis.R") then, run_analysis().
