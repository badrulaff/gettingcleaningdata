### Code Book for run_analysis

This is a code book for project 1 of Getting And Cleaning Data course. 
The purpose of this project is described as follows:-
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
    variable for each  activity and each subject.
The relevant script is "run_analysis.R". The combined data set is also saved as "combined_data.csv" file.
The produced tidy data is in "tidy_data.csv" file.

### Data Definition

The functions 'getTestFile' and 'getTrainFile' reads data from folder test and train respectively.
The assumption is that data files inside 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.
